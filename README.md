# Learning GitHub issue template

Just one of the things I'm learning. <https://github.com/hchiam/learning>

Just create a `.github` folder, and put a `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` inside it, like this: 

<https://github.com/hchiam/learning-issue-template/issues/1>

<https://github.com/hchiam/learning-issue-template/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md>
